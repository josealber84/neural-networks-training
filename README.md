Basic neural network use in R

The neuralnet package seems like a good place to start. There is a simple example [here](http://www.r-bloggers.com/using-neural-networks-for-credit-scoring-a-simple-example/). A more in-depth view of the package can be found in [this paper](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2010-1/RJournal_2010-1_Guenther+Fritsch.pdf).
